Raspinfo
========

Web information display for Raspberry Pi.

Information
-----------

Raspinfo is a simple web information display written in Node.js for Raspberry Pi.  
Many codes and structures are based on [Raspcontrol](https://github.com/imjacobclark/Raspcontrol).  
Raspcontrol is written in PHP and can control RPi, but Raspinfo is written in Node.js and only can see informations of RPi, not controlling.

Dependency
-----------

* Node.js
* Express >= 3.0
* Swig >= 1.0
* [execSync](https://github.com/mgutz/execSync)

Dependency is not accurate.

Notes
-----

Some functions may not work or work unexpectedly in some RPi.
